Application for the postdoc position in Purdue

Hi Professor,

I saw the news from your personal page that you are looking for students now. Your researches are really amazing and attract me so much. I wonder whether you would like to hire a postdoctoral researcher in your lab. 

I am currently a Ph.D student of Beijing Institute of Technology and will get my Ph.D degree in March 2016. My major is Natural Language Processing. Recently, I am researching in how to predict the helpfulness of product reviews, which will be useful for making decisions. xxxxxxxxx



I also did research in multiple news summarization in timeline and implemented this work to a real world project for a bureau in Beijing. Extracting knowledge from personal resumes with a unified framework is also applied in Kanzhun.com, which plays the same role as GlassDoor.com in US.

Cause my research interest is to apply NLP technologies and Machine Learning technologies into real word project, I finished several projects with my group members and the address of my personal github page is: https://github.com/sonyfe25cp.  I believe my technical skills and research experiences qualify me for this position. My curriculum vitae is attached.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I am looking forward to your reply. 

Regards,
Jie Chen
Beijing Institute of Technology, China
