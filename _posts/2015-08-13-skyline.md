###Skyline Query

Skyline Query是Locationbased service中的一种很重要的查询

LBS 主要包含以下：

* Point query
* Range query
* Nearest neighbor
* Shortest path query
* Skyline query

**Skyline Example**

Which hotel is nearest and cheapest one ?

	The skyeline query finds the data items that meet the given conditions as possible.

###Data broadcasting

Data broadcasting provides an effective way to disseminate information to a large amount of mobile clients

* Wireless mobile network is asymmetric
* Server broadcasts data periodically and the clients tune into the broadcast channel to receive data
* Nuber of clients is oftern higer thant servers
* Energy is a scarce resource at the mobile unit//如何省电


####Measuring Performance

* Latency
* Tuning time
	* Time spent listening to the broadcast
	* Controls power consumption
* Memory usage

**Data have spatial and non-spatial attribute**


R-tree is used to index spatial data.

MBR 最小边界矩形

利用坐标X,Y，价格 构成3维空间，然后建立R* tree，寻找Skyline

###Uncertain Data Streams

* Precise data
	* Data without ambiguity
	* e.g. Student's score
* Uncertain data
	* Data having error, incompleteness or ambiguity

####Uncertain Data

* Given a d-dimensional uncertain data set *U*, an ucertain data object *X* is a probability distribution over d-dimesion space


####Simulated Experiments

* EPSU
* CL
* CLG
