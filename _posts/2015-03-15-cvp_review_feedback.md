Strong Points	The paper is well-motivated and easy to follow.
The paper proposed a simple,straight, but reasonable framework for resume information extraction.
Experiments on a real world data set of Chinese resumes shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Weak Points	The reference is too limited. The authors can add more paper on Web IE.
The experiment can be further improved.
Detailed Comments	In this paper, the authors propose a framework to extract knowledge about the person for building a structured resume repository. The proposed framework includes two major processes: the first is to segment text into semi-structured data based on Writing Style, and the second is to further extract knowledge from the semi-structured data with text classifier.
Generally, the paper is well-motivated and easy to follow. It proposed a simple,straight, but reasonable framework for resume information extraction. Experiments on a real world data set of Chinese resumes shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. 
Some suggestions: 1) The reference is too limited. The authors can add more paper on Web IE. 2) Table 2 shows, the performance of the proposed method is not as good as PROSPECT. The reason by the authors is that, the results are acquired on different corpus. The authors are expected to realize and test the PROSPECT algorithm on the same corpus.

Overall Rating	Neutral
Strong Points	(1) topic is interesting.
(2) solution is useful according to the experimental results. 
Weak Points	(1) utility on resumes in other languages;
(2) presentations could be further improved. 
(3) lack of details about the proposed method.
Detailed Comments	This paper proposes a framework to detect the important information in resumes. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Some minor comments/suggestions are provided as follows, which may help improve this paper: 

During the procedure of pre-processing, the authors removed the format, such as table. Is it possible to make better use of the table format? 

The authors defined three types of line type. It would be more interesting if more experimental results with analysis could be provided about each type.

Table 2-4 use F1 as one of the evaluation measures. However, Table 5-7, the authors use “F-value”.

More room could remained for the details of block classification and attribute match in Section 3.5 and 3.6 are required. For example, spaces for Table 2-4 could be condensed. 

The authors should explained Algorithm 1 with more details.
More explanations about evaluation and obtaining ground truth should be added. 

This paper evaluates the proposed solution on Chinese resume. Further work could be investigating the difference of solution on Chinese and English. The proposed solution in this paper is reasonable and could be more generalized. 

Additional space should be removed from the first sentence of Section 3.
