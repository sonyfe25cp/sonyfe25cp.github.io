Hi Professor Goldwasser,

I saw the news from your personal page that you are a professor in Purdue now. Your researches are really amazing and attract me so much. I wonder whether you would like to hire a postdoctoral researcher in your new lab. Meanwhile, I noticed that you also have a startup company work experience which make me very excited to work with you. 

I am currently a Ph.D student of Beijing Institute of Technology and will get my Ph.D degree in March 2016. My major is Natural Language Processing. I did research in multiple news summarization in timeline and implemented this work to a real world project for a bureau in Beijing. Extracting knowledge from personal resumes with a unified framework is also applied in Kanzhun.com, the biggest company review site in China. Recently, I am reasearching in how to predict the helpfulness of product reviews, which will be useful for making decisions. Cause my research interest is to apply NLP technologies into real word project, I finished several projects with my group members and the address of my personal github page is: https://github.com/sonyfe25cp.  I believe my technical skills and research experiences qualify me for this position. My curriculum vitae is attached. 

Thank you. I am looking for your reply. Have a nice day.

Regards,
Jie Chen
